## Programming Exercises - Chapter-3: Basic Data Structures
=====================================================================

##### 1. Modify the infix-to-postfix algorithm so that it can handle errors.
> Please refer to InfixToPostfix.py - very generic question - I have added basic error checking.  

##### 2. Modify the postfix evaluation algorithm so that it can handle errors.
> Please refer to PostfixEval.py - Though there are basic error handling checks - see if you can extend it.  

##### 3. Implement a direct infix evaluator that combines the functionality of infix-to-postfix conversion and the postfix evaluation algorithm. Your evaluator should process infix tokens from left to right and use two stacks, one for operators and one for operands, to perform the evaluation.
> Please refer to InfixCalc.py for implementation and InfixCalc_inout.txt for sample input/output.  

##### 4. Turn your direct infix evaluator from the previous problem into a calculator. 
> Please refer to Calculator.py, Tokenizer.py and Calculator_inout.py for implementation, and sample input/output.
