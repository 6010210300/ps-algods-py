Chapter 4 - Programming Exercises
===================================

#####1. Write a recursive function to compute the factorial of a number.
> Please refer to factorial_rec.py for implementation

#####2. Write a recursive function to reverse a list.
> Refer to list_reverse.py for implementation details

#####3. Write a recursive function to compute the Fibonacci sequence. How does the performance of the recursive function compare to that of an iterative version?
> Please refer to fibonacci.py for iterative and recursive implementation. We have noted the timings as well. Recursive implementation has poor performance in terms of time because there are lot of overlapping problems and each problems gets computer irrespective of whether it has been computed in the past or not. While in the iterative implementation we solve for a specific fibonacci n only once.

#####4. Write a program that prints out Pascalâ€™s triangle. Your program should accept a parameter that tells how many rows of the triangle to print.
> Please see the implementation in pascal_triangle.py file - try out yourself :)
